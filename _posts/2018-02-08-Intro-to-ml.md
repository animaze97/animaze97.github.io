The biggest challenge I faced when I thought of diving into the world of machine learning was — “Where to start?” There are a plethora of written content, videos, etc. What’s the starting point?

Believe me when I say that, if you don’t start in the right direction and end up starting with too advanced stuff, there is a huge possibility that you might not want to continue forward in this field.

I personally faced a lot of problems when I started in this field, so I am writing this article to help my amigos out there who are facing a similar challenge.

So, let’s come straight to the sources:

1)For the starters , just to get a sense of what lies ahead you could follow an online course from the Caltech university taught by professor Abu Mostafa — “Introduction to Machine Learning”. It comprises of 18 videos of about 1.25 hrs each. It’s a pretty good starting point for absolute beginners. Basic arithmetic is prerequisite. And don’t worry if you can’t understand all the stuff in the videos, try taking them slowly, if required watch them more than once, if you still face problem, move forward and try to watch the entire playlist.

2) If you watched the entire playlist above, and still are confused then no worries, the next few sources will clear all your doubts. The next thing you can follow is a blog by Michael Nielson — “Neural nets and Deep Learning”. This is perhaps the best written content I ever came across on neural nets. The language is easy to understand and he tries to take everything right from the base and goes to the depth with plenty of examples wherever required. If you follow this blog, you would have a better understanding of neural nets then many industry experts. It consists of 6 chapters (pretty long though, but definitely worth it).

3) Next you could follow the Deep Learning specialization on coursera by Andrew Ng. The specialization consists of 5 courses. This is the most in-depth content out there. From the derivations of equations to every minute detail, everything is covered in detail in this specialization. A lot of programming exercises are also present to help you master the concepts.

After following these sources you would have a pretty good understanding of this field and what lies ahead, you would be in a position to decide for yourself what you want to pursue further. This is sufficient to get you started in this field (of course there is no end to learning).
