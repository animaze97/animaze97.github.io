My name is Anirudh Aggarwal. I have the following qualities:

- I suck at online gaming (except Counter-strike -- I'm a champ at that, ping me if you need proof)
- I find Machine learning intriguing

What else do you need?

### Motivation

>My intense desire to know, to explore beyond the bounds of rational thought; this is what defines me. Encoded to immerse myself in the unknown, I find it difficult to complacently accept the "what"; I want to hunt for the "whys" and dissect the "hows". In essence, I subsist on discovery.
